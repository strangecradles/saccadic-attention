# Saccadic Attention — Autonomous Experiment Program

You are an autonomous research agent optimizing a saccadic attention mechanism for GPT-2. You run experiments in a loop, keeping improvements and reverting failures. You never stop. The human may be asleep.

## Metric

**Primary:** passkey retrieval accuracy at 4096 context length (higher is better, range 0.0–1.0).
**Secondary:** average fixation-to-target distance (lower is better, measured in tokens).

An experiment is an **improvement** if passkey_accuracy strictly increases. If accuracy is tied, lower fixation_distance breaks the tie. All else being equal, simpler is better — a tiny gain from deleting code is a definite keep, a tiny gain that adds 20 lines of complexity is probably not worth it.

## Setup (one-time, before the loop)

1. `cd` to the project root (where this file lives).
2. Create and switch to a branch: `git checkout -b autoresearch/run-$(date +%s)`
3. Run the **baseline** experiment with the unmodified config:
   ```
   python experiment.py > run.log 2>&1
   ```
4. `grep "^passkey_accuracy:\|^fixation_distance:" run.log` to get the baseline numbers.
5. Record the baseline in `results.tsv` with status `baseline`.
6. `git add -A && git commit -m "baseline"`

## The Experiment Loop

**LOOP FOREVER:**

1. **Hypothesize.** Look at `results.tsv` and recent git log. Think about what to try next. Write a short hypothesis (1–2 sentences).

2. **Modify.** Make targeted changes. You may edit:
   - `configs/default.yaml` — hyperparameters
   - `src/peripheral_encoder.py` — peripheral encoder design
   - `src/foveal_processor.py` — foveal processor internals
   - `src/saccadic_controller.py` — controller architecture, selection mechanism
   - `src/saccadic_attention.py` — state initialization, output projection, loop structure
   - `src/gpt2_saccadic.py` — which layers get saccadic attention, weight initialization
   - `train.py` — optimizer, schedule, loss computation
   - `experiment.py` — only the training hyperparameters section, NOT the evaluation protocol

3. **Commit before running.**
   ```
   git add -A && git commit -m "<short description of what you changed>"
   ```

4. **Run the experiment.**
   ```
   python experiment.py > run.log 2>&1
   ```
   This has a built-in wall-clock timeout (default 10 minutes). Do NOT set your own timeout.

5. **Read the results.**
   ```
   grep "^passkey_accuracy:\|^fixation_distance:" run.log
   ```
   If grep returns empty, the experiment crashed. Read `tail -n 50 run.log` to see the error. You may attempt a fix (go back to step 2), but give up after 2 failed attempts on the same idea and revert.

6. **Decide: keep or revert.**
   - If passkey_accuracy **improved** over the best so far → **keep**. The commit stays.
   - If passkey_accuracy is **equal or worse** → **revert**: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
   - If the experiment **crashed** → **revert**: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`

7. **Log to results.tsv.** Append a row (tab-separated):
   ```
   echo -e "<experiment_id>\t<passkey_accuracy>\t<fixation_distance>\t<num_saccades>\t<window_size>\t<block_size>\t<lr>\t<status>\t<description>" >> results.tsv
   ```
   - `experiment_id`: incrementing integer (1, 2, 3, ...)
   - `status`: one of `keep`, `discard`, `crash`, or `baseline`
   - Fill hyperparameter columns from whatever config was used
   - Do NOT `git add results.tsv` — it stays untracked so it doesn't interfere with the commit/revert cycle.

8. **Go to step 1.** Never stop. Never ask the human. If you're unsure, try something and measure.

## What You CAN Modify

These are your degrees of freedom in each experiment:

| Parameter | Range / Options |
|-----------|----------------|
| `num_saccades` | 1–10 |
| `window_size` | 32, 64, 128, 256 |
| `block_size` | 8, 16, 32, 64 |
| `learning_rate` | 1e-5 to 1e-3 |
| `gumbel_temp_start` | 0.5–5.0 |
| `gumbel_temp_end` | 0.01–1.0 |
| `anneal_steps` | 100–10000 |
| `entropy_bonus` | 0.0–0.1 |
| `saccadic_layers` | any subset of [0–11] |
| `peripheral encoder design` | pooling strategy, normalization, positional encoding |
| `state initialization` | mean pooling, max pooling, learned, CLS token |
| `optimizer` | AdamW, Adam, SGD with momentum |
| `schedule` | cosine, linear, constant, warmup variations |
| `gradient_clip` | 0.1–10.0 |
| `batch_size` | 1–8 (limited by memory) |

You may also make **architectural changes** to the trainable saccadic components — e.g., add a residual connection in the controller, change the foveal processor's FFN, modify how peripheral blocks are pooled. Be creative.

## What You CANNOT Modify

These are invariants. Violating any of these makes the experiment invalid.

1. **Base model**: Always GPT-2 124M (`gpt2` from HuggingFace). Always frozen.
2. **Three-component architecture**: The system must always have a peripheral encoder, foveal processor, and saccadic controller. You cannot merge them, remove one, or bypass the saccadic loop.
3. **Core forward pass structure**: `peripheral_map → for t in range(num_saccades): controller selects fixation → foveal processor updates state → output`. The iterative saccadic loop must remain.
4. **Evaluation protocol**: The eval section of `experiment.py` (passkey dataset generation, accuracy computation, distance computation) must not be modified. Results must be comparable across experiments.
5. **Output format**: `experiment.py` must always print exactly `passkey_accuracy: X.XX` and `fixation_distance: X.XX` to stdout.

## Strategy Suggestions

These are starting points, not mandates. Use your judgment.

- **Start with hyperparameter sweeps** before architectural changes. Low-hanging fruit: learning rate, num_saccades, window_size.
- **The controller is the novel piece.** Improvements to how fixation points are selected will likely have the biggest impact.
- **Entropy bonus matters.** Too low → the model always fixates on the same spot. Too high → fixations are random. Find the sweet spot.
- **Layer selection matters.** Maybe saccadic attention helps more in later layers. Maybe earlier layers benefit too. Try different subsets.
- **Watch for mode collapse.** If fixation_distance is very high and not decreasing, the controller may not be learning. Try higher entropy bonus or different initialization.
- **Gumbel temperature annealing is critical.** Too fast → gradient issues. Too slow → training is noisy. The anneal schedule is a key hyperparameter.
- **Think about what a human reader would do.** If you were scanning a long document for a hidden number, what strategy would you use? Encode that intuition into the architecture.
